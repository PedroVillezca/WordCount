# WordCount
Project developed to count the amount of times each word is included in a given text, in order to aid in the reviewing and correction of written assignments.

Future Plans:

1. Add possibility to read directly from Word documents AND/OR create UI for manual input of text.

2. Have the program look up the top N most used words on the internet and provide possible synonyms if available.
  2.1. Include this functionality for both Spanish and English at least.
