The Characters
Vladimir J. Propp identified eight character functions through his analysis of over 100 popular Russian folk tales. These character functions are broadly used in almost all forms of narrative in general. Due to their origin, these functions are easiest to identify in traditional folk or fairy tales, where the character functions may appear in a quite literal way. However, this does not mean that they aren’t present in other narrative genres. Even in A Silent Voice, an extremely recent Japanese film pertaining to the drama and slice-of-life genres, it is possible to identify many of these functions.
1.	Shouya Ishida, The Hero: Shouya is very clearly the Hero of this story. He is the character whose perspective of the story we follow from beginning to end. Throughout the film, we are exposed to his inner thoughts, as well as the way his cognitions interprets the world around him. He is therefore the most important and relatable character in the film. In addition, he has a general goal of fixing his past mistakes by making amends with his childhood friends and classmates.
2.	Tomohiro Nagatsuka, The Helper: Tomohiro, despite not being the wise or powerful character the Helper usually is in narratives of olden times, fulfills his role as a Helper quite clearly. He is the first friend Shouya makes during the film, which represents a very big step in his character growth during the story. Throughout the film, Tomohiro supports Shouya pretty much unconditionally, as he motivates and aids him to continue his journey of making amends. 
3.	Everyone, The Villain: The villain in this story is a very interesting case, as most characters may have an argument towards being the villain. First off, Shouya himself may be seen as the villain, as he is the one who bullied Shoko in the past and therefore caused the main conflict in the film. However, Shouya is also The Hero of the story, he regrets his actions, and is not morally bad in any way. Shouya’s childhood friends are all also responsible for some part of the drama between the characters. Ishida and Hirose, his best childhood friends, shunned him for being the bully despite having played along with his mocking in the past. Miki tries to place the blame on all others while claiming innocence for herself, which causes internal turmoil within the main group of characters and ignores the fact that she herself badmouthed and didn’t defend Shoko. Naoka was Shouya’s main accomplice in bullying Shoko and, despite the time that had passed between those events and the time where the film takes place, has no intention of apologizing and even claims that Shoko was the one who ruined everything. There can even be a case for their elementary school teacher Takeuchi being the villain, as he was the adult responsible for stopping the mean behavior of his class, but still did nothing to prevent the events from happening. However, he didn’t cause the events himself and was barely relevant throughout the rest of the film, so he isn’t the main villain of the story. Shoko herself plays a small role as the villain towards herself through self-loathing that almost led to her death. In the end, pretty much every single character associated with Shouya’s elementary school class contributed a varying amount towards creating the huge mess the characters try to deal with later on. Because of this, I concluded that this film provides a perspective on modern daily life conflicts: there is not one person responsible for the conflict, as everyone contributed towards it. Therefore, The Villain exists within every character and is not a character in and of itself.
4.	Miyako Ishida, The Donor: Despite Miyako, Shouya’s mother, not participating directly during most of the film, she plays a crucial part in Shouya’s story. What Miyako gives Shouya isn’t necessarily some magical item or deep wisdom. She instead gives him motivations, and she does so both indirectly and directly. In Shouya’s childhood, she was the one who had to pay the price for his misbehavior, as the hearing aids he destroyed cost her a large sum of money and the hatred of Shoko’s mother. Because of this, Shouya saw how much suffering his actions caused his own mother. Afterwards, Shouya became regretful of his actions and became a more kindhearted person, as we can see during the time the film takes place. Had it not been for this, Shouya would not have had any reason to change himself or try to fix his mistakes. In the present, Miyako is the one who gives Shouya a “will to live”, as he had been planning to kill himself once he had repaid her the money she lost due to the hearing aids. However, Miyako noticed this behavior and made him see how important he was to her. Due to this, Shouya continued to live and gave up on the thought of committing suicide.
5.	Nobody, The False Hero: In a similar case to The Villain, The False Hero does not have a character that represents it within the story. However, in this case, the characteristics of a false hero can’t really be attributed to any of the characters in a meaningful way. This is because the characters never participate in deceitful or malicious behavior. The only case where a False Hero could be seen is within Shouya’s elementary school friends: Ishida and Hirose, as they appear to be fully supportive of Shouya’s actions only to cold-heartedly betray him once they were exposed. However, there is one main reason due to which I believe they don’t fulfill the role of a False Hero in the movie: their actions occurred prior to the events of the actual film and did not participate in the conflict itself.
6.	Shouya Ishida, The Dispatcher: This is one of the simplest roles to find in the movie. Shouya, The Hero of the movie, decides by himself to repay his debt to his mother (motivations previously discussed). His own impulses also lead him to try and reunite with Shoko, which, after his failed suicide attempt, resulted in him continuing to make amends with the rest of his past. Thus, The Hero sends himself on a mission, under his own command and due to his own volition.
7.	Shoko Nishimiya, The Princess: Also a very straightforward character function in the movie, Shoko fits the role of The Princess quite well. Her forgiveness and friendship are what Shouya, The Hero, mainly seeks to gain from completing his journey, and he actively pursues her throughout the film. She is, however, not the reward for The Hero upon completing his journey. She participates very often in the story and also has conflicts and motivations of her own, which separates her from fulfilling the role of a generic Princess, but the core concept is very clearly there.
8.	Yaeko Nishimiya, The Princess’s Father: Yaeko is Shoko’s biological mother and plays a minor role in the film, but is also the most obvious character that would fulfill the role of The Princess’s Father. She harbors a deep hatred for Shouya, as he was the one who bullied her daughter when they were kids, and therefore tries to stop Shouya from meeting with her at the beginning, and even later on in the film is still reluctant to let them meet. Thus, she constrains The Princess in her ability to meet with The Hero. Yuzuru, Shoko’s sister, does the exact same thing during her character introduction, since she also wanted to protect her sister. However, she does not uphold this behavior very long and quickly becomes an ally to The Hero, making her unfit for this role.
The Narrative
The Hero’s Journey is a narrative structure based on the analysis of both Christopher Vogler and Joseph Campbell. This structure defines a set of 12 stages that most, if not all, narratives follow. While this structure is easiest to see in stories which follow epic adventures, it is not necessarily limited to that kind of narrative. The slice-of-life genre, which is almost the total opposite of the aforementioned adventure genre, can also have this structure, although it may be a lot harder to see. The film A Silent Voice is no exception, as analyzing its scenes and structure brings to light many of the elements that compose The Hero’s Journey.
•	The Ordinary World: The Ordinary World usually represents the main character of the story in his natural environment, so that the audience can understand and relate to him. It is represented in this movie through a flashback that happens right around the beginning of the movie. This flashback retells the story of Shouya’s childhood, which sets up the plot and conflicts that he will resolve later in the movie. Therefore, these scenes showing his childhood be his ordinary world. He is still ignorant of the adventure he will undertake at this stage. There could also be an argument for the early scenes of the movie after the next two stages, as his world has yet to undergo a change even though Shouya himself has already begun his journey. This other ordinary world represents the world Shouya lived in after the events of his childhood: he is isolated and can’t ever look people in the eye, assumes they are badmouthing him, has no friends and is extremely shy.
•	The Call to Adventure: The Call to Adventure occurs when some sort of unexpected event causes the main character to take action and undergo a change in his life. In this movie, it happens when Shouya visits Shoko for the first time after the flashbacks. After repaying what he owed to his mother and failing to kill himself, he visits Shoko to apologize to her and return a notebook she had left behind when they were children. In other words, Shouya brings The Call to Adventure upon himself by meeting up with Shoko and deciding he would like to make amends with her, which in consequence triggers the rest of the events of the movie.
•	Refusal of the Call: The Refusal of the Call generally occurs shortly after the previous stage and is usually a brief scene in which the main character expresses a negative reaction to the change he must undergo due to fear, uneasiness, or unwillingness. In this movie, it occurs immediately after Shouya asks Shoko if they can be friends. He immediately slaps himself and questions what he is even doing. However, he does not put up any further resistance to this change in his life, despite often questioning his own decision throughout the early stages of the film.
•	Meeting with the Mentor: This stage is usually the point in the story where the main character’s main source of aid or motivation, the mentor, is introduced. In this movie, the mentor role is taken by his mother. Therefore, the Meeting with the Mentor occurs the day after Shouya tries to kill himself. In the following scene, Shouya’s mother heavily scolds him for trying to kill himself and forces him to promise he won’t do it again. She also carries out most of her role as a mentor at this point since she makes Shouya realize why he had continued to live up to that point and motivates him to continue with his life.
•	Crossing the Threshold: The Crossing of the Threshold is the stage during which the character makes the transition from the Ordinary World into the new and unknown Special World. In this film, the Crossing of the Threshold occurs very subtly. After the events of the Meeting with the Mentor, Shouya becomes a little more open to change, and this shows when he takes an interest in one of his fellow classmates that he recognized from his class. He also involves himself when this same classmate was having his bike stolen and stands in for him. Because of this, he befriends his soon-to-be best friend Tomohiro in a scene which visually demonstrates how Shouya’s world begins to change, as Tomohiro’s cross falls off, revealing his face in Shouya’s eyes.
•	Tests, Allies and Enemies: In this stage, the main character usually meets his allies and learns about his enemies. He is also tested in a number of ways now that he is in the special world. In A Silent Voice, this happens over a large amount of scenes. In terms of allies, he meets Tomohiro (his best friend) and Yuzuru (Shoko’s sister), who become his main helpers in dealing with his relationship with Shoko. As for enemies, he has a brief encounter with Shoko’s mother, who hates him to the point of having their first meeting consist of her just walking up to him and slapping him. His tests come in the form of meeting his old classmates again in the process of getting closer to Shoko. This is most apparent when meeting Naoka, who hasn’t grown out of the stage of thinking that bullying Shoko is how things should be and therefore proves to be one big obstacle for Shouya’s goal of overcoming his past mistakes.
•	Approach to the Inmost Cave: During the Approach to the Inmost Cave, the main character and his allies make their final preparations for the ordeal they must face. In the case of this film, this happens when Shouya and his new group of friends visit an amusement park. It is within this event that the relations between all the characters deepen, but also where tensions rise as characters start bringing up their past problems. This stage serves as a build up to the true conflict of the movie.
•	The Ordeal: The Ordeal is one of the most important stages in The Hero’s Journey, as it is here that the hero faces the greatest challenge or his biggest fear. In this movie, it comes in the form of the confrontation Shouya has with his group of friends on the bridge. Here, he lashes out at all his friends, calling them out on the hypocrisy that most of them refused to acknowledge or accept. This seemingly destroys the friendships he had built up throughout the film
•	The Reward: The Reward is a stage in which the hero obtains some sort of treasure, be it material or conceptual, after facing The Ordeal. However, in A Silent Voice, this treasure isn’t very clearly shown. The main character himself doesn’t gain anything directly by facing the ordeal. His true reward lies in the change he caused within the rest of the characters, who needed to face the truth to realize the wrong within themselves.
•	The Road Back: During The Road Back, the hero carries out his journey home, usually while trying to avoid some remaining dangers of the Special World that threaten to make him lose his treasure. In this film, the Road Back happens in the time after Shouya faces the ordeal. He is tasked with trying to continue living after having destroyed his friendships, as well as cheering up Shoko who is revealed to believe that she is at fault for everything that has happened. During this stage, Shouya tries his best to hide his regrets while trying to go back to living a normal life while spending time with Shoko.
•	The Resurrection: The Resurrection is a stage in which the main character is pushed to the brink of death, only to bounce back with even greater power or wisdom. This happens very literally in A Silent Voice. During a fireworks festival, Shoko tries to commit suicide but is luckily saved by Shouya who falls in her stead. While trying to save her, Shouya has an internal monologue in which he decides to look people in the eye, stop avoiding his problems and face the world around him head on, something that he had been trying and failing to do throughout the whole movie. The fall also puts him in a coma. During his sleep, Shoko reaps The Reward that Shouya had obtained earlier on by going to each of the friends involved in The Ordeal and trying to bring them back together for Shouya’s sake. Even Shoko’s mother, who was originally the one who most opposed the interaction between the two, is now appreciative of Shouya. Once Shouya wakes up, he manages to face his friends after a bit of struggling and properly apologizes for everything that has happened, while they do the same for him.
•	Return with the Elixir: In the final stage of The Hero’s Journey, the hero returns to the Ordinary World with his treasure, which brings a change to his way of life within this ordinary world. In A Silent Voice, this is very clearly represented in the final scene of the movie. Shouya, having gone through his resurrection and making amends with his past, is now ready to once again face the world around him. In a very symbolic scene, he uncovers his ears and opens his eyes to the world around him, which he hadn’t done since the time he was ostracized by his friends in middle school. As he does this, the big crosses over everyone’s faces falls off, representing the change in perspective Shouya undergoes. From here on out, his way of life has changed for the better. 
The References
Intertextuality is a concept that is present in every single piece of narrative that we know of today. It is a means of understanding a given film or story using previous knowledge from other narratives. A Silent Voice, however, is a very difficult case when it comes to identifying where it uses intertextuality. Generally, movies are best known for using intertextuality through references or cameos of quotes and characters from other films. In this case, I was unable to identify any references being made to other pieces of media, be it films produced by the same director, series produced by the animation studio that created the film, or the original author’s previous works. In the same way, there were no identifiable cameos in any of the extra and background characters in the film. It is a film that takes itself quite seriously for the most part, so there were also no notable running gags common in the medium. Even the more knowledgeable communities on the Internet have been unable to find such elements within the film.
Because of this, I will focus on a few tropes common to the medium and genre utilized in the film, as they are the most 
The Audiovisuals
Animation as a medium is one that is heavily oriented towards formalism. No matter how much the animators and character designers try to emulate real life in their work, their artistic quirks will always be visible in some form or another. This is especially noticeable in hand-drawn, two-dimensional animation, as is the case in A Silent Voice. This film utilizes a huge amount of formalist techniques, while the only elements of the film that pertain to realism can be attributed to the themes and locations in the film, which are supposed to represent the daily life of Japanese high school students.
One of the first and most noticeable formalist elements are the character designs themselves. Having the characteristic large eyes and colorful hair of Japanese animation, the characters are all noticeably unrealistic in form. Their facial expressions, while believable, are also exaggerated since this movie places an emphasis on conveying a message through more than just words.
The scenes themselves are also formalist in nature. There are a lot of cuts, changes in perspective, and different angles used through the entirety of the film. Furthermore, there are a lot of visual effects and enhancements, such as changes in lighting. This can be seen mostly in the visual effects used in scenes where water is present in the movie, as well as the bright lighting even in nighttime scenes. These effects serve two purposes: to enhance the beauty of the environments in the film, and to create a more emotional, dramatic feeling during the more important scenes in the movie.
The movie also uses music, most notably during the opening and finishing scenes but usually in any emotionally heavy scene. The opening scene has a montage of Shouya’s childhood along with an upbeat, almost retro-sounding song in order to quickly convey the atmosphere of Shouya’s childhood. The ending scene utilizes a much more serene and emotional piano track which evokes an almost dream-like feeling.
Lastly, the ultimate example of formalism in the film is actually present throughout the whole film. Since the film takes place from Shouya’s perspective, the movie also allows us to see the world through Shouya’s eyes. Because of this, a lot of characters have a large, blue cross over their faces, signifying the fact that Shouya has shut these people out of his mind out of fear. As the movie progresses we see how these crosses come off the faces of more and more characters, which represents Shouya’s world opening up to what it really is. 
The Context
There are three main contexts relative to the movie that can be analyzed in order to find some sort of pattern or connection between the messages of the film and the context surrounding it: the time and place at which the film was produced, the time and place the film represents, and the time and place at which the film is being analyzed, that is, the present. However, this film is an adaptation from a pre-existing manga (the Japanese equivalent to comic books) which began releasing its volumes starting from 2013. Because of this, even though the film was published in 2016, most if not all of the contextual influence within the film comes from the time of the source material, as the film adapts all of its scenes and plot points directly from it. Furthermore, neither the movie nor the source material explicitly mention a date in which the film takes place. Therefore, both the first and second contexts mentioned are practically the same and will be analyzed as both taking place in Japan during the year 2013.
There is one especially interesting link between the aforementioned context and the movie itself. In April 1st, 2013, the Japanese government passed a new law that banned bias against people with disabilities. That is, the law prohibited any kind of discrimination towards disabled people, including, of course, deaf people. It also established that the government must pay more attention to their problems and needs. Its main purposes were to ban unjust discrimination and to remove social barriers between regular and disabled people. Because of this, it can be inferred that the author at the time of writing the plot of the film was influenced by this event and wished to create a story about a disabled person that was discriminated. This law may have also influenced the popularity of the original manga, as the Japanese citizens at the time would have become more sensible towards the troubles of disabled people.
A small but interesting connection can be found in the form of an accident that occurred at the 2013 Fukuchiyama Fireworks Festival in Japan. This event caused a low amount of deaths but was still widely spread in Japanese news and media. Because of this, it may have influenced the connection made between the fireworks festival portrayed in the film and the near-death experience that both of the main protagonists experienced during it.
Lastly, it is important to talk about Japan’s suicide culture. Japan is the country with one of the highest suicide rates in the world, and it is therefore a very common theme in many stories involving themes like drama, depression and death. It is because of this that the behavior of some characters, such as Shoko’s little sister Yuzuru who tried to dissuade her sister from committing suicide by showing her awful pictures of dead animals and insects, becomes more understandable. However, during 2013 the suicide rate was declining in Japan. It is possible that this influenced the original author to make suicide an underlying and not a main theme within the plot.
